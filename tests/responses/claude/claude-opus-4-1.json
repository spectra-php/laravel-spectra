    "content": "Quantum computing harnesses the strange properties of quantum mechanics—like superposition and entanglement—to process information in fundamentally new ways that can solve certain complex problems exponentially faster than traditional computers.",
    "thinking": "I need to explain quantum computing in a single, clear sentence that captures its essence without being too technical or too vague. The key aspects are: 1) it uses quantum mechanical phenomena, 2) it processes information differently than classical computers, 3) it can solve certain problems much faster. Let me craft a concise but informative sentence.",
