    "thinking": "I need to explain quantum computing in just one sentence. This is challenging because quantum computing is a complex topic, but I should aim to capture its essence simply and clearly. \n\nKey aspects I could mention:\n- Uses quantum bits\/qubits\n- Can be in multiple states simultaneously (superposition)\n- Processes information differently than classical computers\n- Potentially more powerful for certain problems\n\nI'll try to create a sentence that captures the fundamental difference from classical computing while being accessible.",
