Spectra is a comprehensive Laravel package for AI observability. It helps you track AI requests, measure usage, calculate costs across different pricing units, enforce budgets, and inspect AI operations through a unified dashboard and API. This lets you focus on shipping reliable AI features without getting buried in provider-specific operational complexity.
